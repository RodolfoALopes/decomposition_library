# Decomposition Library

> A C++ library to decompose variables in optimization problems

<!-- Later replace with a better image. Some visualization from matplotlib would do. -->

<!-- Later replace with a better text: problem, why it's useful, why it's unsolved, what this lib does -->
Decomposition methods are useful components of optimization algorithms. This project is a C++ decomposition library for continuous optimization problems.
